Add validations to your models automatically based on the schema constraints.
Place this one line in your model:

validations_from_schema


| schema type | rails validation          | extra                     |
|-------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|
| non-null    | validates_presence_of     |                           |
| string      | validates_length_of       | :limit                    |
| integer     | validates_numericality_of | :only_integer, :less_than |
| float       | validates_numericality_of |                           |


Tested on MySQL.
Does not detect what database is being used.
This gem may have problems on other databases, particularly Sqlite.
